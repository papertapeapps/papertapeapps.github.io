        In-App Browser
<br><br>

    In the app you may save links (URLs) to external websites or resources. 
<br><br>

    When you select a saved link, by default the link will open the website or resource in an in-app Safari web interface. If you decide to access any websites or resources with the Safari web interface within the app, you do so entirely at your own risk and subject to the terms and conditions of use for such websites and resources as well as Apple's Safari terms and privacy policies.  
<br><br>

    Opening saved links may expose you, via the saved links, to malware and/or may expose data including but not limited to your device IP address and location. 
<br><br>

    Interactions with the web interface, AutoFill data, browsing history, and website data aren't visible to the application and we cannot access this data. 
<br><br>

    You can update your settings to open saved links in an external browser by visiting the Settings page and switching off the "Open In-App browser" toggle.
<br><br>

    Link Previews
<br><br>

    By default, the application automatically opens saved links in the background to fetch the "metadata" or the preview of the linked website or resource. 
<br><br>

    By saving links and enabling link previews within the Services, you access the linked websites and resources entirely at your own risk and subject to the terms and conditions of use for such websites and resources. 
<br><br>

    Saving links and enabling link previews may expose you, via the saved links, to malware and/or may expose data including but not limited to your device IP address and location.
<br><br>

    You can update your settings to turn off link previews by visiting the Settings page and switching off the "Show Previews" toggle. This will stop saved links from being opened in the background and will stop the link metadata from being fetched.
